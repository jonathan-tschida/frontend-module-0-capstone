        <p>Dungeons & Dragons (D&D for short) is a tabletop roleplaying game.
          It is a game about rolling dice and telling stories.

            <h3>The Dungeon Master</h3>
            <p>The Dungeon Master (or DM for short) is a special role taken on by one of the players.
            The DM is the story teller and also acts as a referee of sorts.
            The DM is responsible for creating the world of make-believe that the players will explore.
            Taking on the role of DM is a lot of work, but can also be more rewarding.
            Players who are highly organized and very imaginative will enjoy this role.

            <h3>The Players</h3>
            <p>The rest of the players in your group will be experiencing and interacting
            with the world of make-believe set forth by the DM.
            Players do this through the lense of their characters, which I will cover later.
            While the DM establishes the world of make-believe, the players shape it through their actions.

            <p>D&D is a lot like a theatrical production, before you can tell a story it is important to establish your setting and characters.

            <h3>Choose Your Adventure</h3>
            <p>In order to play D&D you will first need to decide upon an adventure for your party.
            An adventure is a broad term that encompasses all the information the DM needs to set the scene and direct the action.
            A typical adventure includes details about the setting and creatures and non-player-characters (NPCs) the players might encounter.
            The adventure you choose is a blueprint for the story of your D&D sessions.

            <p>Any good theatrical production needs some main characters, and in D&D that responsibility falls to the players.
            Each player will create their own character, complete with a personality of their own.
            Characters have certain attributes and qualities, some of which have numerical values.
            A <a href="https://dnd.wizards.com/articles/features/character_sheets">character sheet</a>
            will help you keep track of all of these attributes.
            To get a starting point for character creation you will want to choose your character's Race, Class, and Background.
            Try playing around with this form to get some ideas for your character.

      <div class="content">
        <div class="sub-section one">
          <div class="center">
            <p>Actually playing the game works as follows:</p>
              <ol>
                <li>The DM describes the environment</li>
                <li>The players describe what they want to do</li>
                <li>The DM describes the results of the players actions</li>
              </ol>
            <p>It gets a little more complicated than that (which I will get into
            next), but that is the basic flow of the game.

          <div class="center">
            <h3>Setting the Scene</h3>
            <p>Before the characters can interact with the world around them, the DM must first establish the setting.
            This includes the setting, any NPCs in the area, and what is going on in the scene.
            For example the DM might narrate as follows:
            "It's late at night and your party has just arrived at a bustling tavern.
            As you enter you see all sorts of people drinking and talking loudly as barmaids run about."
            </p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="sub-section three">
          <div class="center">
            <h3>The Players Act</h3>
            <p>Once the scene has been set, the players are now able to act!
            Players can do all sorts of things depending on the situation.
            Using the tavern from the previous section as an example,
            a player could choose to chat up one of the barmaids,
            challenge another patron to a drinking contest, or even start a brawl.
            You can have your character do anything you would be able to do in real life, and more!

          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="sub-section four">
          <div class="center">
            <h3>Resolution</h3>
            <p>After a player has described to the DM what they want their character to do,
            the DM then decides how the action is resolved.
            Sometimes this involves simply relaying information to the player.
            For example, if a character decides they want to ask the barmaid
            if there are any specials today, the DM would resolve that action by
            having the barmaid answer the question.  Other types of interactions
            involve less certainty and the DM may require dice to be rolled to determine the outcome.
            When this is the case, the DM judges the difficulty of the task and
            sets a threshold that must be met in order to succeed at the task.
