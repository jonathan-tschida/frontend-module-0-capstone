        <p>Dungeons & Dragons (D&D for short) is a tabletop roleplaying game.
          It is a game about rolling dice and telling stories.

      <h2>What You Need</h2>
      <div class="subSectionOne" id="needSection">
        <p>You only need a few things to get started playing D&D.
          Paper, pencils, dice, and a group of friends is all you really need to get started!
          You can even download <a href="https://dnd.wizards.com/articles/features/basicrules">the basic rules</a> for free!

    <div class="section">
      <h2>Group</h2>
      <div class="subSectionOne" id="groupSection">
        <p>D&D is a social game, so at a bare minimum you are going to need some friends to play with.
          A group consists of at least two people, one of which will take on a special role.
          </p>
      </div>
      <div class="subSectionTwo" id="dmSection">
        <h3>The Dungeon Master</h3>
        <p>The Dungeon Master (or DM for short) is a special role taken on by one of the players.
          The DM is the story teller and also acts as a referee of sorts.
          The DM is responsible for creating the world of make-believe that the players will explore.
          Taking on the role of DM is a lot of work, but can also be more rewarding.
          Players who are highly organized and very imaginative will enjoy this role.
          </p>
      </div>
      <div class="subSectionThree" id="playerSection">
        <h3>The Players</h3>
        <p>The rest of the players in your group will be experiencing and interacting
          with the world of make-believe set forth by the DM.
          Players do this through the lense of their characters, which I will cover later.
          While the DM establishes the world of make-believe, the players shape it through their actions.

      <h2>Establishing a Narrative</h2>
      <div class="subSectionOne" id="contentSection">
        <p>D&D is a lot like a theatrical production, before you can tell a story it is important to establish your setting and characters.
          </p>
      </div>
      <div class="subSectionTwo" id="adventureSection">
        <h3>Choose Your Adventure</h3>
        <p>In order to play D&D you will first need to decide upon an adventure for your party.
          An adventure is a broad term that encompasses all the information the DM needs to set the scene and direct the action.
          A typical adventure includes details about the setting and creatures and non-player-characters (NPCs) the players might encounter.
          The adventure you choose is a blueprint for the story of your D&D sessions.

        <p>Any good theatrical production needs some main characters, and in D&D that responsibility falls to the players.
          Each player will create their own character, complete with a personality of their own.
          Characters have certain attributes and qualities, some of which have numerical values.
          A <a href="https://dnd.wizards.com/articles/features/character_sheets">character sheet</a>
          will help you keep track of all of these attributes.
          To get a starting point for character creation you will want to choose your character's Race, Class, and Background.
          Try playing around with this form to get some ideas for your character.

      <h2>Playing the Game</h2>
      <div class="subSectionOne" id="playSection">
        <p>Actually playing the game works as follows:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>The DM describes the environment</li>
            <li>The players describe what they want to do</li>
            <li>The DM describes the results of the players actions</li>
        </ol>
        <p>It gets a little more complicated than that (which I will get into
          next), but that is the basic flow of the game.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="subSectionTwo" id="narrateSection">
        <h3>Setting the Scene</h3>
        <p>Before the characters can interact with the world around them, the DM must first establish the setting.
          This includes the setting, any NPCs in the area, and what is going on in the scene.
          For example the DM might narrate as follows:
          "It's late at night and your party has just arrived at a bustling tavern.
          As you enter you see all sorts of people drinking and talking loudly as barmaids run about."
          </p>

      <div class="subSectionThree" id="actSection">
        <h3>The Players Act</h3>
        <p>Text about player actions.

      <div class="subSectionFour" id="resultSection">

        <h3>Player's Handbook</h3>
        <img src="images/DnD_PHB.jpg" alt="Cover of the Player's Handbook" class="book" />
        <p>The Player's Handbook (PHB) contains all the complete rules for the game, including character creation.
          The PHB is a must-have for players and DMs alike.

      <div class="subSectionThree" id="mmSection">
        <h3>Monster Manual</h3>
        <img src="images/DnD_MM.jpg" alt="Cover of the Monster Manual" class="book" />
        <p>The Monster Manual (MM) contains statistics and information on
          a wide variety of creatures you might encounter in your adventures.
          Mostly useful for DMs, as they will need to keep track of monster statistics during combat,
          though players can learn more about the world of D&D through the monsters that inhabit it.
          </p>

      <div class="subSectionFour" id="dmgSection">
        <h3>Dungeon Master's Guide</h3>
        <img src="images/DnD_DMG.jpg" alt="Cover of the Dungeon Master's Guide" class="book" />
        <p>The Dungeon Master's Guide (DMG) is by no means required in order to be a DM.
          However, it does contain all sorts of great tips, tricks, and tools for being a successful DM.
          Players will find little use for this book unless they are considering taking over the role of DM eventually.

      <h2>Other Books</h2>
      <div class="subSectionOne" id="moreBookSection">
        <p>There are many other great officially published books to supplement your D&D experience.
          </p>
      </div>
      <div class="subSectionTwo" id="sktSection">
        <h2>Published Adventures</h2>
        <p>Published adventures are a great way to start an adventure.
          They provide all the information your DM needs to get you started on a story.
          Storm King's Thunder, for example, is a published adventure involving fighting all kinds of Giants.
          </p>
      </div>
      <div class="subSectionThree" id="voloSection">
        <h2>Additional Rule Books</h2>
        <p>In addition to the core rule books,
          there are supplemental rules that are published that give players and DMs even more content to work with.
          Volo's Guide to Monsters gives players more options for their characters' races, as well as giving DMs
          more insight into existing monsters and statistics for new monsters not in the Monster Manual.
