# The 5 Main Ingredients of UX

### Psychology: How much work does the user have to do to get what they want?

**Good:** [Twitch.tv](https://www.twitch.tv/): Users want to watch people livestreaming, and are greeted by the discover tab where a livestream is already playing. They can browse to find something else, or search for something specific.

**Bad:** [Pinterest](https://www.pinterest.com/): Users are forced to create a pinterest account before they can even just browse the site, being linked to something on pinterest will show the content briefly before a popup blocking desired content asking users to log in or sign up. Giving out an email is a big commitment just to see what your site is about, considering it is supposed to be a pretty casual website.

### Usability: Could you get the job done with less input from the user?

**Good:** [Google](https://www.google.com/): It's just their logo and a search bar.  That's all you need for a search engine. Clean, but effective.

**Bad:** [Connect For Health Colorado](https://connectforhealthco.com/): Clicking on anything having to do with logging in or signing up redirects you to a new tab for a different site.  The whole first page feels useless, why not just put the log in on the front page?

### Design: Do users think it looks good? Do they trust it immediately?

**Good:** [Total Wine](https://www.totalwine.com/): Looks like how most retailer's websites should. It is clear what they sell just from the images and you can browse products.

**Bad:** [Tipsy's Liquor](http://tipsysliquorworld.com/): Main page is a picture of a building, takes a second to realize what the website is for.  Overall the styling is very clunky and does not encourage readability.


### Copywriting: Does it sound confident and tell the user what to do?

**Good:** [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/): Text is short, sweet, and packs a punch.  Every piece of text starts with an action verb (Find, Post, Connect, Learn) that gives the user an idea of what they can do.

**Bad:** [Tumblr](https://www.tumblr.com/): The wording is awkward and uses passive language.  Does not motivate the user to take action. The front page copy ends by stating that they lied in their earlier copy, yikes.


### Analysis: Are you looking for subjective opinions or objective facts?

**Good:** [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/): The Youtube algorithm for what content they recommend to you uses all types of subjective and objective data.  Hard numbers like the number of views of the video, the number of subscribers of a channel, and average watch time of the video are used in conjunction with more nebulous data like keywords and like ratios to give the user videos that will keep them watching.

**Bad:** [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/):  Reddit runs almost exclusively off of upvotes and downvotes (likes/dislikes), pushing content towards the top of the page the more upvotes it has.  This often results in a positive or negative feedback loop where things upvoted early are more likely to get upvoted often, and things downvoted early are unlikely to be seen.
